<p>  The India-Australia relationship is at an all-time high. The pace and scale of our cooperation have been growing swiftly since our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership was agreed upon in 2020. The recent summit between the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, on 21 March called for a new level of ambition to drive our cooperation forward, especially focusing on our economic cooperation.
  And since education is a sector that holds great potential, the Prime Ministers have announced a Taskforce on Education Qualifications Recognition at the aforesaid summit. This task force is meant to address the recognition of different delivery modes, including online and blended learning, joint degrees, and education at offshore campuses. The task force will deliver a mechanism for expanding education qualification recognition between Australia and India by the end of the year, with its implementation planned for 2023.</p>
