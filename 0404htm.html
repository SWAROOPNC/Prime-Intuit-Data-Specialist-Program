    <p>he India-Australia relationship is at an all-time high.
      The pace and scale of our cooperation have been growing swiftly since our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership
      was agreed upon in 2020. The recent summit between the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and the
      Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, on 21 March called for a new level of ambition to drive our
       cooperation forward,
      especially focusing on our economic cooperation. And since education is a sector that holds great potential,
       the Prime Ministers have announced a Taskforce on Education Qualifications Recognition at the aforesaid summit.
       This task force is meant to address the recognition of different delivery modes, including online and blended
       learning, joint degrees, and education at offshore campuses. The task force will deliver a mechanism for
       expanding education qualification recognition between Australia and India by the end of the year, with its
       implementation planned for 2023.</p>
      <p>Since the early 2000s, Australia has become a destination of choice for Indian students pursuing higher education
         internationally. In 2019, around 1,15,000 Indian students were studying in Australia. Indeed, Indians are one
         of the largest proportion of migrants who call Australia home. Many Indians continue to work in vital positions
         in the Australian industry, academia, and government. Thousands of Indians who studied in Australia have even gone
         on to develop successful global careers.
       Australian education is in the top tier of demand globally due to its high quality, strict accreditation standards,
        sophisticated support for international students, relevant curriculum, and one of the highest graduate
        employability rates delivering a better return on investment. Australia has one of the most supportive
        international education systems in the world, and it is clear from how the Australian Strategy for
        International Education 2021-2030 puts the student experience, student protection and students' rights
         at the core.</p>
